==============

``xrd-image-util`` provides users with tools to analyze and visualize 2D detector data from X-ray diffraction experiments.
This project works as an interface to databroker and bluesky, provding additional functionality while still 
allowing users to access databroker's ``BlueskyCatalog`` and ``BlueskyRun`` objects. In its current form, ``xrd-image-util`` 
is tailored for data gathering at APS beamline 6-ID-B.
