==============

`xrd-image-util` provides users with tools to analyze and visualize 2D detector data from X-ray diffraction experiments.
This project works as an interface to databroker and bluesky, provding additional functionality while still 
allowing users to access databroker's `BlueskyCatalog` and `BlueskyRun` objects. In its current form, `xrd-image-util` 
is tailored for data gathering at APS beamline 6-ID-B.

.. warning::

    This project is currently under development.
